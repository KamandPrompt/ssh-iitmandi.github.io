We have all tried to shorten our code at some point or another in our life. But, it hasn't been much fruitful. Not because we can't do it. But because there wasn't any significant reward for doing so.
Guess what, now you get a reward for writing the shortest possible code as a solution. Seems interesting, isn't it?

Institute of Technology Mandi, is organising a coding challenge on HackerEarth. This  is a [codegolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) challange. Simply put, just make your code shortest and solve the problem. The fewer characters you use, more points you get.
Though what's priceless is solving interesting problems and the thrill of competition. To deal with it, you require a level patience and skill that escapes ordinary programmers.

We invite you to take up this opportunity to bring out the programmer in you. The right code with minimum characters is all thats required to win.Are you ready? :)

So, we at [ssh-iitmandi](https://ssh-iitmandi.github.io) would like to invite you all for  [CodeGolf](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/college/iitmandi/) at HackeEarth. The contest will start on [July 28,2017 at 9:00 pm IST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeGolf&iso=20170728T21&p1=176&ah=3).

## Rules
## Problems and Definition
   1. There will be 5 algorithmic problems.
   2. Contest will be for 3 hours.

## Scoring
  1. Though you have to pass all the test cases, you will be scored on the basis of the length of your source code. (Thats the twist)
  2. Lesser the number of characters used, higher will be your rank on the leaderboard :D
  3. Maximum Scoring : 50 — 100 — 150 — 200 — 250
